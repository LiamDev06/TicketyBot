# Tickety Bot
Tickety is a simple ticket discord bot that I made as a trial project to join the Bot Developer freelancer team at [RocketCreations](https://discord.gg/rocketcreations).

## Features
- Ticket panel (send the ticket creation panel via a slash command)
- Database storage (store all tickets and the message history using MongoDB)
- Activity management (automatically close down a ticket if it becomes in-active)
- Transcript (upon ticket close, a transcript .log file is sent containing all messages sent in the ticket)
- Modals (instead of old-fashined "!" commands and reactions, the bot uses slash commands and buttons)
- Configurable (configure settings like timeout, transcript channel, category to create in and more)

Note that this is a simple and lightweight bot with a minimal amount of features.

## Disclaimer
This was a one-time temporary project and is not acitvely maintanied nor does it receive frequent updates/fixes. It is NOT meant to be run even though it's technically possible to compile and build it.
